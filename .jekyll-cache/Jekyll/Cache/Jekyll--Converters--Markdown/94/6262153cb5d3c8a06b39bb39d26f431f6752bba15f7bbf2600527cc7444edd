<p>Hi! My name is Mauricio Laine, and Iâ€™m a software engineer interested in mobile Android development, machine learning, algorithms, data structures and web application development.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s Degree in Computer Science &amp; Engineering at the University of Washington. I have been working in the field of mobile app development for the past five years, and I have more than seven years of professional experience.</p>

<p>My current focus is on machine learning mechanisms to identify objects in mobile applications. Also, Iâ€™m learning React Native to build native apps.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m passionate about solving computational problems, trying new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently.</p>

<p>When not coding. Iâ€™m usually hiking, taking <a href="https://ml-photos.com/">photos</a>, or <a href="https://lainejourney.com/">traveling</a>.</p>
