I"c<p>Hi! My name is Mauricio Laine, and I’m a software engineer interested in mobile Android development, machine learning, algorithms, data structures and web application development.</p>

<p>I’m currently pursuing a Master’s Degree in Computer Science &amp; Engineering at the University of Washington. I have been working in the field of mobile app development for the past five years, and I have more than seven years of professional experience.</p>

<p>My current focus is on machine learning mechanisms to identify objects in mobile applications. Also, I’m learning React Native to build native apps.</p>

<p>I’m passionate about solving computational problems, trying new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently.</p>

<p>When not coding. I’m usually hiking, taking <a href="https://ml-photos.com/">photos</a>, or <a href="https://lainejourney.com/">traveling</a>.</p>
