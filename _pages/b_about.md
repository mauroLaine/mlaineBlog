Hi! My name is Mauricio Laine, and I’m a software engineer interested in mobile Android development, machine learning, algorithms, data structures and web application development.

I’m currently pursuing a Master’s Degree in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. I have been working in the field of mobile app development for the past five years, and I have more than seven years of professional experience.

My current focus is on machine learning mechanisms to identify objects in mobile applications. Also, I’m learning React Native to build native apps.

I’m passionate about solving computational problems, trying new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently.

When not coding. I’m usually hiking, taking [photos](https://ml-photos.com/), or [traveling](https://lainejourney.com/).
