This project provides a tool for BLV people to improve their interaction with currency via a mobile app in multiple languages. Blind and vision-impaired people can use this app as a tool to identify and manage the amount of cash they have in their pocket.

The approach from the team was to use image labeling. However, the challenge was to identify the value of each currency since the model only recognized bills and coins but not values on any of them. In order to achieve the recognition of every bill and coin value, the team implemented a customized ML model built with a plethora of images of currencies.
