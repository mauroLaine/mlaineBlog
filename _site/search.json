      "content"  : "In the era of rapid digitalization, the encryption of sensitive information has risen to the forefront of technological priorities. The Cipherescom mobile application, aspires to redefine the approach toward data privacy and security by leveraging advanced cryptography techniques. By using the device’s camera, the application captures an image, extracts any embedded text using the advanced capabilities of ML Kit Text Recognition v2 API, and subsequently encrypts the content using AES encryption in GCM mode with a robust 256-bit key. The final encrypted file provides a comprehensive security layer, preventing unauthorized access and en- suring the sanctity of confidential information.Video DemoYou can find the source code at GitHub: Cipherescom"

      "content"  : "This project provides a tool for BLV people to improve their interaction with currency via a mobile app in multiple languages. Blind and vision-impaired people can use this app as a tool to identify and manage the amount of cash they have in their pocket.The approach from the team was to use image labeling. However, the challenge was to identify the value of each currency since the model only recognized bills and coins but not values on any of them. In order to achieve the recognition of every bill and coin value, the team implemented a customized ML model built with a plethora of images of currencies.Video DemoYou can find out more info about this project, as well as the video presentation at accessiblecurrency.com.Here is the source code for Accessible Currency at GitHub: accessibleCurrency."
